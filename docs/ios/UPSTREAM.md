# Upstream sources copied into `shared/`

Format: `source path @ 19f2865 -> destination path`

C2 did not copy anything from `app/`. `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/openstrap/shared/ble/BleBridge.kt`
and its test are new code written for the iOS plan (the Swift/Kotlin BLE boundary) and were taken
verbatim from the plan pack, not from the Android app.
